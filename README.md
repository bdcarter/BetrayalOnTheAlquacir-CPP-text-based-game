# Betrayal on the Alquacir
This is a text-based puzzle game completed as my final project in Introduction to Computer Science. 

It is set on a pirate ship, you play as an elvin pirate who is trying to solve the murder of her father, the captain. 
   You will navigate through the different rooms of the ship looking for clues and talking with crew members. When all clues
   are found, you will name the killer and see if you are correct!
